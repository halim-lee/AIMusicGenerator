MIDI_files_original			contains all original MIDI files from Maestro

numpy_files				contains midi files as .csv files - easy to read but kinda memory inefficient

MIDI_files_processed			contains midi files reconverted from numpy
					this is what a theoretical output might look like since it doesnt have program msgs
